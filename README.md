# CouchDBClient
Couch DB .NET Client

I just started the code, so not much to look into from the usage standpoint.


# Building & Running the code

Solution contains a demo project in it, which is a console app.
Just run that demo, and it will ask you to enter one of the supported commands into the console.

Demo assumes that you have CouchDB running under http://localhost:5984/
